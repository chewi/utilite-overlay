utilite-overlay
===============

A Gentoo Portage overlay for the CompuLab Utilite. Useful for other i.MX6 devices too. There is currently an additional fbdev branch for supporting the framebuffer-only version of the Etnaviv driver. The master branch supports the DRM version but this driver is not yet complete.
